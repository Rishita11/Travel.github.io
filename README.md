# Travel.github.io

I have designed a website for the ease of traveling across India. I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its full-fledged work.

Most of the websites currently provide either the description of places to visit or booking flight/train tickets. Few of them help in the hotel booking in a particular city. I have designed a website name "WOW Travels" which will tackle all these issues in a single place. 

It is divided into three sections:
1) Destinations- This page will consist of the names of various cities such as Mumbai, New Delhi, etc. On clicking on each city you will be directed to a page describing various places to visit in that particular city. 
2) Hotel booking - This will help you browse the top hotel chains such as ITC, etc. in that city. This will help them in finalizing their trip easily without worrying about their stay in that city.
3) Flight booking- This will help them book flights. It will consider the Sign-Up and Sign-In pages to help them save their data for further use.
